Layers used to generate Efterian EFTs.

EFTs, or Extremely Fungible Tokens, are a parody of and alternative to NFTs. They are free to download, distribute, and modify.

This repository contains the layers used to generate all of the first generation EFTs in the Efterians collection.

You may use them however you wish, however I ask that you consider making whatever you create out of them free for anyone to use, and I also ask that you consider refraining from minting any creations resulting from my work into NFTs. With that said, there's absolutley nothing stopping you from doing whatever you'd like with them.

Hashlips Art Engine was used to geneerate the EFTs: https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine

Thank you for supporting the EFT/anti NFT movement.
